# Forcing Processor
Forcingprocessor converts National Water Model (NWM) forcing data into Next Generation National Water Model (NextGen) forcing data. This tool provides the forcing pre-processing for the [NextGen Research DataStream](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream).

The motivation for this tool is NWM data is gridded and stored within netCDFs for each forecast hour. Ngen inputs this same forcing data, but in the format of catchment averaged data time series data.

## Setting Up a Python Virtual Environment on Ubuntu
To avoid the externally-managed-environment error and ensure you can install packages without affecting the system Python, follow these steps to create a "sandbox" (Virtual Environment).

## 1. Install the venv tool
If you haven't installed the virtual environment module for Python yet, run:

Bash
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-venv
```
## 2. Create your sandbox
Create a folder (usually named .venv) that will hold your local Python executable and libraries:

Bash
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```
## 3. Activate the environment
You need to "enter" the sandbox so your terminal knows to use the local Python version:

Bash
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Tip: Once activated, your terminal prompt will usually show (.venv) at the beginning of the line.

## 4. Install your project in editable mode
Now that you are inside the virtual environment, you can safely install your package and its dependencies:

Bash
```
pip install -e .
```
Note: You will need to run source .venv/bin/activate every time you open a new terminal window to work on this project. To exit the virtual environment, simply type deactivate.

## Run the forcingprocessor
```
python src/forcingprocessor/processor.py ./configs/conf.json
```
Prior to executing the processor, the user will need to obtain a geopackage file to define the spatial domain. The user will define the time domain by generating the forcing filenames for `processor.py` via `nwm_filenames_generator.py`, which is explained [here](#nwm_file). Note that `forcingprocessor` will calcuate weights if not found within the geopackage file.

### Channel Routing Data Extraction

This tool can also extract `q_lateral` data from the NWM's channel routing data sources. This is
helpful for experimenting with routing simulations. Note that channel routing data extraction
cannot be run at the same time as forcing data extraction at this time. This use case requires a
mapping file ending in `map.json` in the format
```
{ngen-nex-id-1: [nwm-id-1-1,...],
.
.
.
ngen-nex-id-k: [nwm-id-k-1,...]}
```
where the list of `nwm-id`s are the NHD reaches associated with that NextGen hydrofabric nexus.

## Example `conf.json`
```
{
    "forcing"  : {
        "nwm_file"     : "",
        "gpkg_file"    : ""
    },

    "storage":{
        "output_path"      : "",
        "output_file_type" : []
    },

    "run" : {
        "verbose"       : true,
        "collect_stats" : true,
        "nprocs"        : 2
    },

    "plot":{
        "nts"        : 24,
        "ngen_vars"  : [
            "DLWRF_surface",
            "APCP_surface",
            "precip_rate",
            "TMP_2maboveground"
        ]
    }
}
```

## nwm_file
A text file given to forcingprocessor that contains each nwm forcing file name. These can be URLs or local paths. This file can be generated with the [nwmurl tool](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/nwmurl) and a [generator script](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/forcingprocessor/blob/main/src/forcingprocessor/nwm_filenames_generator.py) has been provided within this repo. The config argument accepts an s3 URL.
 ```
 python nwm_filenames_generator.py conf_nwm_files.json
 ```
 An example configuration file:
 ```
 {
    "forcing_type" : "operational_archive",
    "start_date"   : "202310300000",
    "end_date"     : "202310300000",

    "varinput"     : 5,
    "geoinput"     : 1,
    "meminput"     : 0,
    "urlbaseinput" : 7,
    "fcst_cycle"   : [0],
    "lead_time"    : [1]
}
 ```

## Weights
To calculate NextGen forcings, "weights" must be calculated to extract polygon averaged data from gridded data. The weights are made up of two parts, the `cell_id` and `coverage`. These are calculated via [exactextract](https://github.com/isciences/exactextract) within [weights_hf2ds.py](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/forcingprocessor/blob/main/src/forcingprocessor/weights_hf2ds.py), which is optionally called from forcingprocessor.

If a geopackage is supplied to forcingprocessor, it will be searched for the layer `forcings-weights`. If this layer is found, these weights are used during processing. If not, forcingprocessor will call [weights_hf2ds.py](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/forcingprocessor/blob/main/src/forcingprocessor/weights_hf2ds.py) to calculate the weights (cell_id and coverage) for every divide-id in the geopackage. This can take time, so forcingprocessor will write a parquet of weights out in the metadata, that can be reused in future forcingprocessor executions.

Example of direct call
```
python3 forcingprocessor/src/forcingprocessor/weights_hf2ds.py \
--outname ./weights.parquet \
--input_file ./nextgen_VPU_03W.gpkg
```
